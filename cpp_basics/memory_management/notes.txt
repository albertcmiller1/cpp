Memory management is required to avoid wasting memory and to make sure allocation takes palce efficently 
    > ex) During the decloaration of arrays, sometimes the exact memory is not known to us, and that is why we declare an array of max size, which results in wasting memory 
    > can use memory allocation to avoid this 

two operators that are used for the allocation and deallocation of memory 
    > new operator 
        > dynamic memory allocation (allocate at runtime)
        > responsible fo rthe creation of the object
        > can be overloaded 
        > the return type of new is the type for which the memory was allocated 
        > it automatically computes the size of the data object 
        > it can initialize object while creating a memory for it 
    > delete operator
