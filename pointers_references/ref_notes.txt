what is a reference? 
    > an alias for a variable 
    > must be initialized to a variable when declared
    > cannot be null 
    > once initialized, cannot be made to refer to a different variable 
    > very useful as function parameters
    > can be thought of as a constant pointer that is automatically dereferenced


L-values
    > object that occupies a location in memory 
    > values that have names and are addressable 
    > modifiable if they are not constants 

    > ex) int x {100}; // x is an L-Value 

R-Values 
    > non-addressable and non-assignable 
    > a value that's not an L-Value 
    > on the right-hand side of an assignment expression 
    > a literal 
    > a temporary which is intended to be non-modifiable 

    > ex) int x {100}; // 100 is an R-Value 
    > ex) int y = x + 100; // x + 100 is an R-Value 


L-Value References 
    > the reference we are used to are L-Value reference, because we are referencing L-Values 
    > int x {100};
    > int &ref1 = x; // ref1 is a reference to an L-Value 
    > ref1 = 999;
    > int &ref2 = 100; // Error: 100 is an R-Value
