arrays
    > fixed in size 
    > same datatype 
    > stored contiguously in memory 
        > well techincally seperated by the number of bytes taken up by the datatype inside the array 
    > no check to determine if youre out of bounds (programmers responsiblity)
    > ex) element_type array_name [number_of_elements]
    > the name of the array represents the location of the first element in the array at index 0

vectors
    > dynaimc array 
    > will resize as needed so no out of index errors occur 
    > its a contain in the cpp standard libary 
    > an array that can grow and shrink at execution time 
    > can provide bounds checking 
    > had cool functions like sory, reverse, find, etc
