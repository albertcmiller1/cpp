building = compiling + linking 
    compiling => translating to machine code 
    linking   => linking created objects and dependencies to a.out

operators: 
    > +, -, =, ::, etc 


preprocessor directives 
    ex) #include <iostream>

    process the included files for us to use 
    commonly used to conditionly compile code like if ur on windows or machine
    preprocessor does not understand cpp code


namespaces: 
    std::cout 
    std   => namespace (cpp standard namespace)
    count => function definition 
    ::    => scope resolution operator 


    example: 
        using namespace std;
            this will tell the compiler all the func defintions should come from the std namespace 


    other ex) 
    using std::cout; 
    using std::cin; 
    using std::endl;
        this will allow us to use these functions without defining the namespace across the entire file 
        it will only import these three functions
